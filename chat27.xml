            <Utterance genid="1" time="28 January 2013 15:00">Mr PortesYou seem highly concerned with credibility.Is it credible to compare, or even to imagine, that bond market participants might wish to distinguish between a party that has been in power nearly 3 years and one that has recently come to power? Have you even looked at French vs UK debt auction schedules? You are effectively saying that it is impossible for the UK govt to have gained some credibility yet simultaneously for the French situation to have worsened, the basis of you&amp;#39;re claim or argument being that because the French could NOT have earned confidence (presumaby it is too soon since their election) then the reason for there rates moving down MUST be the same as the reason that UK rates have moved down. Why should it be the same? And would you reverse your position if French rates move higher?</Utterance>
