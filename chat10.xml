It&amp;#39;s good for us to be in the club, playing by the rules. Trade barriers hurt both sides in the long run&amp;quot; etc.</Utterance>

            <Utterance genid="2" time="5 April 2013 02:01">We pay a high price for free trade within the EU. I think our net contribution is about &amp;#163;8billion for about &amp;#163;140billion worth of exports to other EU countries, and then there is the cost of implementing and complying with EU rules and regulations on top of that.Keeping the free trade (and we are net importers from the rest of the EU so it would be in the other members interests) while losing the downsides seems sensible. Even keeping the free-ish movement of labour is probably in our interests as a service based economy.</Utterance>
